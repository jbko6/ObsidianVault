- Seattle Great Fire
6 June 1889
Wharfs burned so resupplying Seattle is difficult
- building code
City raised grades in Pioneer square
Widened Front Street and Second Avenue, connected Front Street to Commercial Street
City established paid professional fire department
Insurance companies pushed for the building code and fire department
Code:
	Stone and brick masonry walls required in downtown area
		On property lines dividing lots
		Dividing a building wider than 66 feet
		(Control fire by compartmentalization)
	Limits on size of bay windows
	Prohibition of wood cornices
	Requirement for fireproof roofing materials
- load-bearing masonry
Shift the weight onto the walls
Beams jut into the brick walls to be supported by them
One floor at a time
	Construction paused for the winter, resumed in the spring
- partywalls

- Pioneer Building
Office building
Lots of windows (for daylight)
Interior atrium
- Burke Building
Building of a leading Seattle entrepreneur and investor 
Stone base, brick above
Now fragmented
- Bailey Building
All stone elevations facing main streets
Streets facing alleys are brick
No arches
Many buildings added additional floors - optimism about the growth of Seattle
- Seattle National Bank Building (Interurban Building)
Very Romanesque
Young architect

1893-97 is a break in Seattle development due to a recession
