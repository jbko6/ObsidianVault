Focusing on the indigenous people of the Salish Sea. Extends from the Puget Sound to the Strait of Georgia along with the Strait of Juan de Fuca
These people shared a similar approach to building
Salmon was the primary food
Built **shed-roof plank houses**
	These were multi-use buildings
	Found throughout the Salish Sea
	These buildings could be quite large
	These were only found in this region
	Sometimes the planks were removed for summer with the frame remaining
	Were the largest buildings in North America at the time
Multiple ideas of indigenous peoples' migration
	Through a land bridge across Alaska
	Along the coast in boats
Salish people were hunter-gatherers
Many Salish village sites found throughout the Puget Sound
	These were winter villages
	In the summer they would move around
Salmon flourished in the Northwest up to 5000 years ago
Salish people became experts at catching Salmon - stabilized food source
**Western Red Cedar**
	The most important tree for Salish peoples
	Grew tall and without many knots, good for building with
Not really such a thing as property ownership, rather things were owned including the planks that made up the houses
Typically only 2 or 3 cedar plank houses per village
**Building a plank house**
	First put posts in place
		Posts are notched at the top
		Taller posts on the beach side so the beams slope down
	Next put the beams up
		Took the use of many mechanisms like fulcrums and levers
	Next put up the rafters
	Next the interior and exterior poles go up
	Planks are installed between the poles
	Next the roof
		Roof planks usually had grooves so that they interlocked and kept rain out
How did they get the planks?
	Used a wedge
	Planks split away from the tree after a certain point
Planks are held together with a cedar withe sling
Some posts were decorated
Most of the interiors were smoky and drafty
These houses were primarily shelters for the winter
Cultural events would take place during the winter
Feasts, repairs, and production would take place
These houses could be as long as 210 meters (640 feet long) or even longer up to 714 feet

Past European settlement and things like nails are introduced, indigenous dwellings start to look more like European housing
