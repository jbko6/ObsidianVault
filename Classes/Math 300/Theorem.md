A theorem is a true statement obtained by a [[Proof]] from [[Axiom]]s and previously proved theorems.

Might also hear a theorem referred to as a lemma (a theorem only used to prove a larger theorem, or a proposition, a complex theorem)

Example:

Theorem: $1+2+3+\dots+n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$
The proof: 

```handdrawn-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.2.6",
	"filepath": "Ink/Drawing/2025.1.8 - 9.45am.drawing"
}
```

$n(n+1)=2(1+2+\dots+n)$
So then $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}=1+2+\dots+n$

This was proof by picture, but to prove this more concretely we could use the commutative property.
$((1+2)+3)+\dots+n$
Match up $+1$ and $n$, $2$ and $n-1$ and so on. Each of these will add up to $(n+1)$. So we will end up with $\left( \frac{n}{2} \right)$ pairs.
This is assuming that we are working with integers.
