A set of [[Axiom]]s that define integers

Supposing $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are integers
- Closure: $a+b$ and $ab$ are integers
- Substitution of equals: If $a=b$, then $a+c=b+c$ and $ac=bc$
- Commutativity: $a+b=b+a$ and $ab=ba$
- Associativity: $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$ and $(ab)c=a(bc)$
- The distributive law: $a(b+c)=ab+ac$
- Identities: $a+0=0+a=a$ and $a*1=1*a=a$
	- 0 is called the additive identity
	- 1 is called the multiplicative identity
- Additive inverses: There exists an integer $-a$ such that $a+(-a)=(-a)+a=0$
- Trichotomy: Example one of the following is true: $a>0$, $-a>0, a=0$
