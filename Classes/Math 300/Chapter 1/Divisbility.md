[[Definition]]: Let $a$ and $b$ be integers. We say that $a$ divides $b$ or that $b$ is divisible by $a$, if there exists an integer $c$ such that $b=a*c$.

$a$ is **even** if it is divisible by 2 (there is an integer $k$ such that $a=2k$)

$a$ is **odd** if there is an integer $k$ such that $a=2k+1$.
	A different definition would be that $a$ is odd if $a$ is not even
	Note: we don't know yet that every number is either odd or even, we will prove that later
