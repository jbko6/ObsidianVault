An axiom is a [[Statement]] that we agree to be true
We cannot prove or disprove it

Examples
	If $x*y=y*x$, then something is commutative
	For all integers x and y, $x*y=y*x$ (all integers are commutative)
	For all integers x, there is another integer y such that $x+y=0$
		We could call y the additive inverse
		Write $y=-x$
		Then $-x=(-1)*x$ <- this in and of itself could be called an axiom, although calling it a [[Theorem]] may be more accurate
