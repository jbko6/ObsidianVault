[[Proof]]:
$-a$ is the integer $b$ for which $a+b=0$.
$(-1)*a$ is the integer that is the product of the additive inverse of $1$ and $a$ since $1+(-1)=0$.

We will start with $(1+(-1))*a=0*a$.
We have proved $0*a=0$
Now we used the distributive law and commutative
$1*a+(-1)*a=0$
Since $1*a=a$, we see that $(-1)*a$ is an additive inverse of $a$.
There could be multiple additive inverses of $a$.
