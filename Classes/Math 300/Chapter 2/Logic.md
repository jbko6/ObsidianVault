	Make new statements from old statements

Logical symbols
1. Negation: $P$ (statement) $\to$ not $P$ ($\neg P$)
	- $P:2+3=5$ (T)
	- $\neg P:$ it is not true that $2+3=5$ (F)
	- $Q:17\text{ is even}$ (F)
	- $\neg Q:$ it is not true that 17 is even, "17 is odd" (T)
	**Truth table:**

| $P$ | $\neg P$ |
| --- | -------- |
| T   | F        |
| F   | T        |
	Negation is not the same as the "exact opposite"
	"It is raining every day" -> It is not raining every day -> there exists at least one day where it is not raining
2. And (conjunction)

| $P$ | $Q$ | $P\land Q$ |
| --- | --- | ---------- |
| T   | T   | T          |
| T   | F   | F          |
| F   | T   | F          |
| F   | F   | F          |
