### Spaces of Identity
Japan's past left a massive mark of the collective conscience of the west and other east Asian countries
For centuries Japan had been dehumanized as exotic
	"Both the 'chrysanthemum and the sword'"
However, in the end, Japan also absorbed the west
On the other end, the West only viewed Japan with spectacle
However, in the 80s and 90s, this Western dominance was challenged
Japan started saying no to the West as it developed a lead on new technologies
As America suffered a loss in Vietnam, it became ever more apparent to Japan that their modern era was over
As this occurred Japan encroached on traditionally Western symbols
	Nippon TV network paid $3 million for the restoration of the Sistine Chapel
	Rockefeller Center was acquired by Japanese real-estate interests
	Sony bought Columbia pictures
"There is a fear that, in contrast to Western openness, Japan is characterized by a culture of self-censorship"
While America is characterized by plurality, Japan is characterized by homogeneity
Others argued that the idea of cultural chauvinism is no longer appropriate in the age of globalization
The Japanese strategy of global localization is stealthy and scares Americans
The West seeks to protect its concept of modernity from Japan
Now the idea of modernity has shifted from West to East
The roles have reversed; now the Japanese see the West as exotic and the West envies the East's discipline and industrial efficiency
The fear of this process occurring had been stirring for some time - dating back to 1903
This sort of shift had occurred before
	The shift from the Mediterranean to Europe
	In the process, all annals were rewritten such that Europe was the center of the world
		Christianity originates from Europe now
		Hellenic thought annexed to Europe
		Jews and Arabs were forced outside the West and into the Orient
	Now the Japanese are taking the place of the Jews
		People who strut in borrowed plumage
		People who don't know how to enjoy themselves or are too focused on wealth
		In a middleman position between the current dominant culture and the Other
How did Japan get its modernity?
	By being invaded, defeated, and exploited by the West
	Japan was given the gift of modernity
	Shows in Akira, there are so many that worship Akira's destruction of old Tokyo and wish for it to occur again
However, in achieving modernity, Japan threatened the traditional Western Eastern model
Like the West, Japan has also held its discourses about the supposed superiority of its country
	Most countries have this
However, Japan only recently held the power to put these idea in force
"American Exceptionalism" vs "Japanese Uniqueness"
Technology is really coming to signify the positions of the East and West in their war with each other
"if the future is technological, and if technology has become 'Japanized', then the syllogism would suggest that the future is now Japanese too"
How has the West coped with this?
	One way is to exoticize this new technology and link it with the idea that it's really just an evolved form of zen and kabuki
	Postmodern romanticization of Japan as a space between the real and the imaginary
	Another response is to see Japan's new technology as inhuman and empty
	"Western xenophobia and racism are motivated by the apparent incapacity of a culture to constitute itself without excluding, devaluing, and hating the Other"
	Japan reveals the ugliest parts of Western culture
	Japan inserted itself into modernity on its own terms and thus threatened the racist foundations of modernity
	The West simply reworks old stereotypes: "they" are barbaric and "we" are civilized; "they" are robots while "we" remain human

Could argue that the Other culture destroys its identity with itself to advance itself and to redefine itself

### Neo Toyko and the Dying City
Old Tokyo is depicted as mostly low-rise with a few skyscrapers, while Neo Tokyo is depicted as a tall city
The rest of the world is also absent
The island nature of Neo Tokyo harkens back to More's Utopia form 1516
Both cities are forced to maintain a connection to their old past
There's a strong link between Neo-Tokyo and the Metabolists
Rather than severing its connection to its past, Neo Tokyo reserves its umbilical cord to Old Tokyo and thus fails to become a Utopia
Some Metabolist thinkers saw the city as a biological being, one that was constantly maintained and rebuilt
	The atom bomb simply expelled deal cells
Rather than functioning as an anti-paradigm, Old Tokyo served as a den for the seedy parts of Utopic Neo Tokyo
Old Tokyo is dead, but still infects Neo Tokyo
The original idea of Utopia is that of constant improvement, not of still perfection
"Neo Toyko is heaven for the rich and hell for the poor"
Neo Tokyo is both a failed modernist city and a postmodernist city
Late capitalism corrupted the city and turned it into a tool for production output
Neo Tokyo is stuck in a death spiral and thus longs for its own destruction
In traditional cyberpunk media, the artificial co-opts the natural
	Cyborgs, endless megacities that overpower nature
	A futuristic society transformed by technology but stuck in political, social, and economic crisis
However, Akira takes a more biopunk approach
	Seen more evidently in the transformation of Tetsuo at the conclusion of the film
While Akira uses the visual language of cyberpunk, its themes more so match biopunk with its fears of technology infecting the body
Biopunk is modern with its fear of biomedicine, while cyberpunk is postmodern with its embrace of the cyborg
Neo Tokyo is a city that believes itself to be a utopia, and which has thus stopped innovating, and now believes true utopia to be its destruction
Historically, the idea of restoring justice is a violent idea in Japan
	Destructive/restorative deities were associated with natural disasters like earthquakes
	These earthquakes destroyed the estates of the wealthy and equalized the wealth
	*Omoto-kyo*
Neo Tokyo and the world of Akira as a whole is stuck in a cycle of rebirth as it attempts to build a utopian world
"Neo Tokyo suffers from an untreatable disease and begs to be euthanized"
Both Blade Runner and Akira have some form of technophobia
	In Akira, this fear focuses on the hubris of modern science and believes it is uncapable of conquering nature's mysteries
	In Blade Runner, this fear focuses on humanity's recklessness in dealing with nature; that by pursuing progress we leave behind our humanity and destroy our very nature

While both Blade Runner and Akira are shaped by technophobia, their genuine fears are quite different; In Akira, this fear focuses on the hubris of modern science and believes it is uncapable of conquering nature's mysteries. In Blade Runner, this fear focuses on humanity's recklessness in dealing with nature; that by pursuing progress we leave behind our humanity and destroy our very nature. Central to these fears are the historical contexts that support them. In Akira, this fear is founded on Japan's newfound technological superiority. Departing from the traditional framework of West and Orient is terrifying, even for those pioneering the transformation. Japan wonders how long its post-modern era can persist, or, in other words, how long until its world must be destroyed and rebuilt again. In Blade Runner this fear stems from the Japanese threat against Western economic, technological, and cultural dominance. Blade Runner posits Japan's new technology as inhuman, too detached from nature and overpowering our humanity. These xenophobic views are found throughout the set design of Blade Runner, as the Western bastion of Los Angeles is transformed by alien oriental elements; foreign food, depravity, ruthless efficiency.

**Central claim:** A culture's anxieties surrounding technology are inherently linked to its perspective of its current control of that technology.
- **Supporting claim:** In the Western sphere, prior to the 1980s, the primary fear was that control over technology would be lost (as is reflected in biopunk media)
- **Supporting claim:** During the 1980s, in the Western sphere, a new fear emerged: That humanity's (subtext: foreigner's) control over technology was too great, to the extent that it destroys humanity's nature.
- **Supporting claim:** During the 1980s, in the Eastern sphere, the biopunk fear was adopted, because of the Eastern sphere's dominance over technology
- **Tying it together:** Just as the 1980s saw an inversion in technological dominance, so too did the fears that each sphere held
- **Looking forward / why does this matter:** ??? Touch on solarpunk?? anxieties about climate change
