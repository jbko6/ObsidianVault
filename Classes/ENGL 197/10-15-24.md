#### The Library of Babel
"Magical Realism"
	Style of writing that emerged in South and Central America
	Not exactly fantasy, but has elements of  it to be taken as a symbol
Very meticulously described
Meaning exists within a context
	Anything is only meaningful within a context
	Extends to architecture
	Our gov. buildings look like Greek/Roman buildings because the founders wanted to build out the idea that America stemmed from their values
"I say that the Library is unending. The idealists argue that the  
hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space."
	We need windows for comfort
"They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is  
inconceivable."
	Highlights arbitrariness of how we lay out our spaces
"The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its  
hexagons and whose circumference is inaccessible."
	We try to ascribe a center to things that don't even have a center, highlights how we try and make things fit our models
