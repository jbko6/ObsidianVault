Three terms to think about human perception
	Real
		Senses
	Imaginary
		Derived from our perceptual processes 
		What makes a blue rectangle a door
	Symbolic
		Cultural

In our Ekphrastic Exercise we tried to focus only on the "real", but now we want to move into the imaginary and symbolic

Phenomenology
	Studying the human experience and how the human experience affects what we create
	How do you perceive and how do you communicate experiences
	As we age things that were once enjoyable may not be as enjoyable anymore
		Ex. playgrounds
	Our expectations also depend when it comes to our perception of things

Paratext
	Text not a part of the actual document but added on to the side
	Example: Title, footnotes

There are four words in writing that you always want to do but really can't so you must strike a balance
	Clear
	Concise
	Precise
	Pithy
		Meaningful, deep
Need to weigh these and figure out which is most important.
