Plato believes in forms
	Platonic
	Most things don't come as a perfect representation of something else
	However, there are levels to how close something is to perfect
	The ideal can never be realized but we can get really close
Arts vs Crafts
	Dorian Grey "All art is quite useless"
	Art doesn't have use, but it can have value
	In some interpretations art is less "art" when it has a purpose
	Because architecture has a purpose but is also made functional, it's in this weird subspace between art and crafts, even though many philosophers and artists consider the two to be incomparable. 
	Over time the reputation of media has changed
		For example novels used to be considered like reality TV today
Vitruvian Triad
	Vitruvius' three keys to architecture
		Firmitos
			Firm
			Durability or physical strength
		Utilitas
			Utility
			Functionality
		Venustas
			Beauty
			Venus (Roman god of beauty)
	Also seen in the Vitruvian man

There are ways that architecture is mimetic
	Like how CEO offices are at the top, like how the head is at the top of the body
There are styles in architecture that are mimetic for their associated cultural values
	Like how government buildings look like Greek architecture.
DaSein
	Means to be
	Particular to humans
"Architecture can be oppressive"
		Example is the panopticon
			Prison where you never know if you're being watched
Nobody just decides to do something
	There are always influences and motivations
	Our architecture is influenced by people with money
