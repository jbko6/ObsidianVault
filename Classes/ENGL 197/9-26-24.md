#### Semiotics
Signs and symbols
Either "signifier" or "signified"
Symbols are all around us
The word "tree" is a singifier to an actual tree, which is the thing being singified.
Another example is the floppy disk signifying the save button.
No matter what the case, signs are socially negotiated.
Know your audience when you're writing
You can't control how your audience is going to interpret what you release, so you should take into account how your portray what you're saying.
There are two sides to every piece of media, the side of the person releasing it and the side of the person taking it in.
