### Systems of 3 linear equations and 3 unknowns
How do we solve this in an algorithmic way?

$x+2y-z=10$
	This is a 3d plane
	A co-dimensional object
$2x-y+z=0$
	Another plane
	These planes will intersect at some point because the left-hand sides are not geometrically the same.
	They will intersect in a line.
$3x+y=15$
	Three things that could happen with 3 planes.
	Could be no intersections of all three.
	Could create a line intersection
	Could create a point intersection
	These three equations have no solution.
Allowable moves
	Reorder equations
		$\begin{matrix}x+2y-z=10\\3x+y=15\\2x-y+z=0\end{matrix}$
		Won't help us here.
	Multiply an equation by a non-zero constant
		$x+2y-z=10$
		$4x-2y+2z=0$ <- multiplied by 2
		$3x+y=15$
		Won't help us here.
	Add one equation to another
		$x+2y-z=10$ <- first equation
		$3x+y=10$ <-added the second equation
		$3x+y=15$
		No way this is true, so there are no solutions.

$x_{1}-3x_{2}+2x_{3}=-1$
$2x_{1}-5x_{2}-x_{3}=2$
$-4x_{1}+13x_{2}-12x_{3}=11$

Rewrite into matrix
$\begin{bmatrix}1&-3&2\\2&-5&-1\\-4&13&-12\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}-1\\2\\11\end{bmatrix}$

Add second equation to first equation times -2 (trying to get all zeroes below the diagonal). We are trying to get the matrix in triangular form. We'll get the first column done first.
$x_{1}-3x_{2}+2x_{3}=-1$
$0x_{1}+1x_{2}-5x_{3}=4$
$-4x_{1}+13x_{2}-12x_{3}=11$

$\begin{bmatrix}1&-3&2\\0&1&-5\\-4&13&-12\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}-1\\4\\11\end{bmatrix}$

Work on the third equation. We'll add 4 EQ1 to EQ3:
$x_{1}-3x_{2}+2x_{3}=-1$
$0x_{1}+1x_{2}-5x_{3}=4$
$0x_{1}+1x_{2}-4x_{3}=7$

$\begin{bmatrix}1&-3&2\\0&1&-5\\0&1&-4\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}-1\\4\\7\end{bmatrix}$

Replace equation 3 with EQ 2 + EQ 3
$x_{1}-3x_{2}+2x_{3}=-1$
$0x_{1}+1x_{2}-5x_{3}=4$
$0x_{1}+0x_{2}+x_{3}=3$

$\begin{bmatrix}1&-3&2\\0&1&-5\\0&0&1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}-1\\4\\3\end{bmatrix}$

Now we can read off the solution because the matrix is in triangular form.

EQ3: $x_{3}=3$
EQ2: $x_{2}-5(3)=4$
EQ1: $x_{1}-3x_{2}+2x_{3}=-1$, $x_{1}-3(19)+2(3)=-1$, $x_{1}=50$
Solution: $x_{1}=50$, $x_{2}=19$, $x_{3}=3$

##### Why can we add equations together and have them still be valid?
As we add one equation to another, what we end up doing is sweeping the planes around the solution. The plane itself does not remain geometrically the same, but the solution itself remains constant.

Example:
EQ1: $x+y=5$
EQ2: $x-y=1$
2EQ1 + EQ2 = $3x+y=11$
Solution:
$x=3$, $y=2$
Solution remains valid.
This won't work if there is no solution to both before you add them.
