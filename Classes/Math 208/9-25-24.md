Matrices and linear algebra allow us to solve complex problems (with many unknowns and equations) easily by following set rules and methods

Especially when there are many dimensions (beyond 2d or 3d)

2 equations + 2 unknowns = 3 possibilities
	1 unique possibilities
	No solutions
	Infinitely many solutions

## 1 unique solution
```desmos-graph
x+2y=3
x+y=0
```
$x+2y=3$
$x+y=0$
$0x+y=3$
$x+3=0$
$x=-3$
Unique solution when the two lines are not parallel

## No solutions
When lines are parallel
```desmos-graph
x+2y=5
x+2y=7
```

## Infinitely many solutions
When lines are geometrically the same
```desmos-graph
x+2y=5
-2x-4y=-10
```
