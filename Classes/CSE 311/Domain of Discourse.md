We define one "type" / "domain" that we work over for clarity. This is called the domain of discourse. For example, integers is a type

Example:
	"x is a cat", "x barks", "x ruined my couch"
		x could be mammals, sentient beings, cats and dogs
	"x is prime", "x=0", "x>0", "x is a power of two"
		x could be the integers, could be the numbers
