When two propositional logic expressions have the same truth table, we call them equivalent

Examples:
- [[Implication]] and its proposition

When we use the equal ($=$) sign, we mean the formula is the exact same thing written twice

When we use the equivalence ($\equiv$) sign, we mean the formula is equivalent (same truth table).
