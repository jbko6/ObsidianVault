We will use $p,r,q, s$

We will use the truth variables $T$ for true and $F$ for false
These are booleans and we will also use boolean operators with these
Negation (not)
	$\neg p$
Conjunction (and)
	$p\land q$
Disjunction (or)
	$p\lor q$
Exclusive or
	$p\oplus q$
What is exclusive or?
	$p\lor q$ at least one of $p$ or $q$
	$p\oplus q$ exactly one of $p$ or $q$
Logical connectors
	[[Implication]]
		$p\implies r$
	[[Biconditional]]
		$p\iff r$
