Palimpsest: A manuscript or piece of writing material on which the original writing has been effaced to make room for later writing but of which traces remain

Something reused or altered but still bearing visible traces of its earlier form

Metaphorically, a city may be considered a "palimpsest"

Just as one can try to read the traces or layers on a palimpsest, we can try to "read" the layers that make up our city

The physical form of the city will be our primary evidence, but we will also use other sources such as original documents, historical photographs, and published texts

Buildings are often the best evidence of design and construction, but they don't tell observers about the designer's intentions
	Buildings are also often altered

The human fabricated world is divided into public and private
We all share the public realm (streets, sidewalks, squares, parks, public buildings, and so on)
We share the private realm with members of our families and with others by invitation

Virtually all human-centered buildings and sites result from the work of many different people.

We are relying on a selective group of photographs
We need to imagine what being in spaces in like based on these
Will need to engage with these images
