What is architecture?
	"A bicycle shed is a building. Lincoln Cathedral is a piece of architecture." - Nikolaus Pevsner, 1943
	Another way to think about architecture is to say that anytime humans are creating shelter at any time, then that is architecture
	"Architecture can be defined as 'the ambitious creation of an environment separate from the natural environment" - Spiro Kostof, 1985
	"In the widest sense, architecture is everything built or constructed or dug out for human occupation or use." - Crouch + Johnson, 2001
	"Architecture is the unavoidable art." - Leland Roth
