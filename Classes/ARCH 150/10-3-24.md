Relationship between materials, their properties, and the architecture that is created with them
Relationship between the qualities of architecture and its surrounding climate and environment

How can we visualize a 3d building in 2d?
	Plan and section
	Diagrams
		Useful for comparing or inspecting details
	From these views we can infer the materials that went into the building
