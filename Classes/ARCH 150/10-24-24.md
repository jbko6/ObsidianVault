### Ritual, Procession, and Civic Space: Persepolis, Athens, and Beyond
How did Persian architecture express the idea of empire?
How did Greek buildings respond to the landscape?

##### The Persian Empire
By 512 BCE the Persian Empire stretches across Assyria, Egypt, Palestine, and parts of Greece
Large road system connected the territories
Royal Palace, Persepolis, Iran, 518-460 BCE
Persepolis is a new city started by Darius and extended by Xerxes
Heavily fortified building
Main gate is elevated by a series of ramps
Rooms have many columns similar to Greek structures
Rooms for administrative people living at the palace
Now more than just a house for the king
Borrows a lot from other cultures
	Egypt - impressions similar to Egyptian art on the walls of the ramps
Has a room similar to the Hypostyle Hall with many columns
	Effect is different though because the columns are much more widely spaced
	Capitals are incredibly detailed statues
	Animals depicted on the capitals
	Columns are fluted
	Most similar to ionic capitals

##### Athens
Pre-eminient city-state in 5th c. BCE Greece
Athens led the Greeks in repeated wars with the Persians
Agora = marketplace and civic space
Stoa = shelter for shops and citizens
Athens emphasized democratic participation and created spaces for this in the city
Word for democracy originates with Greek polis (demos = people, polis = city)
Bouleuterion - council chamber
	Gathering place for democracy
Athenian democracy was a representative democracy - representative met in the bouleuterion
Stoa - all purpose building for shops, offices, and shelter
Used for commercial purposes and general gathering
Open space for people to walk through
Socrates would walk through the covered stoa and talk with his students
Acropolis of Athens
	Very steep approach up to two gateways
	Several temples and statues dedicated to various gods
	Many people would process up to the acropolis
	Proceed through the Propylaia (gateway)
	Acropolis buildings not aligned on axis, but organized so that they are all seen in 3 dimensions when you enter from the Propylaia
	Optical refinements accommodate the deforming nature of human vision: proportions of adjusted, columns swell and lean in, no lines are entirely straight
	Doric frieze: Triglyphs & metopes
	Pediment sculpture
	Impressions of people fighting and on horses
	Athena - Goddess of war and military strategy
	Erechtheion: Ionic temple
		Adjacent in foundation to the first temple to Athena
		Preserved as a memory of its destruction by the Persians and of Athen's recovery
Ionic columns
	First imported from Asia Minor
	3-part column form with a base, fluted shaft, and scrolled captial (volute)
	On the porch of the Erechtheion the columns are sculpted women draped in cloth
	As these sculptures progress through the ages they become more natural in posture
Temple of Apollo Epicurius, Bassai, ca 450-425 BCE, Iktinos
	Ionic temples are connected to the wall - unique
	One freestanding column with a new capital form
	Corinthian capital!!!!!!

##### Hellenistic Architecture
4th c. BCE forward
Alexander the Great
Conquers the Persian Empire
Sanctuary of Asklepios, Kos, ca. 300-150 BCE
	Similar to something from Egypt, axially aligned
