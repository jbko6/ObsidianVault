### Empire Building: China and Rome
Ca. 200 CE

How did China's early emperors inscribe "Chinese" into their urban settlements?

First Emperor:
	Qin Shi Huangdi
	Qin Dynasty - 221-206 BCE
The Great Wall
	Military fortifications
	Initial fortifications united into one continuous wall in 221 BCE
Qin Shi Huandi Tomb Mound near Xian c. 221-210 BCE
	Tomb itself hasn't been excavated but supposedly the inside contains models of China at the time
	Consists of several trenches
	Vaults contain terra-cotta warriors
	Initially the warriors were thought to be all unique but now roughly 100 variations have been found
	Initially 8000 warriors were found, but 2000 more have been found
		These new statues are in the civil sector instead of the military sector

Han Dynasty 206 BCE - 220 CE
	Now we should consider the Silk Road
City Planning
	Confucian Classic
		Capital city should be 9 by 9 li (4.5 km)
		3 gates on each wall
		9 streets, 9 avenues, each wide for 9 horse carts
		Palace in the center
	Planning is seen in Chang'an (modern Xi'an)
		Oriented to the cardinal directions
		Gridded city with an administrative center
		Imperial palace at the north
	The Chinese courtyard house is organized similarly to the Chinese temple and city
		Housing in China is more than just housing
Two wooden structure framing systems
	Tailiang  - pillars and beams
	Chuandou  - pillars and transverse tie beams
Bracket framing / Dougong
	Roof eaves cantilever far outside the building posts and beams support the heavy terracotta roof

#### Republican and Imperial Rome and its Colonies
To what extent were the transformations in Roman architecture that occurred in the imperial period (1C BCE - 5C BCE) reflected?

Archaic Rome of the 8th-7th c. BCE - unimpressive and swamp-ridden

Roman Forum - civic heart of the city
	Temples, basilicas, and other important buildings
	Republican senate ruled the Curia
	Sacred Way, via Sacra: ceremonial route to the Capitoline hill
Oldest settlement was the Palatine Hill
Principal temple was on the Capitoline

Imperial Fora
	Several spaces built to deify the Emperors who built them
	Different ones for Trajan, Julius Caesar, Augustus, Nerva, etc.
	Trajan's is the largest
	Open Columnade courtyard
	Immediately facing you is a very large Bascilica
	Also Column of Trajan, where Trajan was buried
