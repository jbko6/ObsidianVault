How did the Romans incorporate and develop architectural ideas from their predecessors?
How did technological developments in architecture contribute to the rise of the Roman Empire?

Rome as a city developed in the 8th - 4th centuries BCE between the Etruscans and the Greeks
The legendary founding of the city of Rome dates to 753 BCE - April 21st.

Etruscan Culture - tomb, writing, and sarcophagus
	Invented the true arch
		Two rows of blocks that face inwards towards the center of the arch
	Corbelled arches are based on the cantilever, known for millennia
	True arch is based on a system of mutual pressure that locks of the stones in place
		Allows a long span and strong support

Romans built a large system of engineered roads
	Mile markers indicated the distances measured from the center of the capital

Romans also built vast networks of Aqueducts
	Carried water supply
	Carried water from high reservoirs into the cities below
	Famous example: Pont du Gard in France, 20 BCE
		Three tiers of arches, water channel is the highest tier

Roman barrel vaults
	Ashlar masonry blocks
	"Temple of Diana" in France

Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia, Praeneste (now Palestrina), 80 BCE
	Ramps and terraces define a processional route through the site

Although Rome itself was chaotic in nature, Roman colonies were very structured and had strict architectural hierarchy
	Castrum = camp
	Roman camps and settlements had two principal cross streets
	Well defined grid

Timgad, Algeria, ca. 100 CE
	Roman colony
	Colonnade lines the main street
		Road lined with columns holding up a covered section

Pompeii, Italy 6th Century BCE - 79 BCE
	Gridded street organization
	Much of the town is still buried
	Destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius
	Large forum at the intersection of crossing arterial streets
	Open space, but closed in by an outlining colummade
	Basilica - multi-functioning gathering space similar to the Stoa
	Pompeii's streets were lined with sidewalks, multi-story buildings with shops at street level and dwelling units above
