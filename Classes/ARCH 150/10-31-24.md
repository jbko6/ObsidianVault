### Empire Building: Rome, Central America and China

Roman Houses
	Roman houses were arranged around courtyard spaces
	As you progress through the house, the courtyards become increasing more private
	Domus = single family courtyard house
	Atrium = formal entry courtyard
	Peristyle = private courtyard surrounded by columns
	Roof is open to provide an opportunity for water to be caught in the courtyards
	Roman houses had dining rooms and bedrooms

##### Empire In Central America (Mesoamerica)
Mainly looking at Teotihuacan and Tikal
Three major cultures
	Olmec
		Developed writing, pottery, astronomy, **maize**
		Olmecs may have been a "mother" culture to the other predominant ones
		Strongly axially
		Strong orientation to the natural landscape
		Outwardly focused building
		Interior spaces were restricted
		Astronomical knowledge reflected in orientation
	Maya
	Aztec

Teotihuacan
	Huge city
	As large as Rome
	Oriented to the cardinal directions, the mountain peaks, and the stars
	Population between 100,000 and 200,000
	City centered around the monuments
	Major temples aligned around the "avenue of the dead"
	Pyramid of the Moon ends the axis with Cerro Gordo (Gordo Hill beyond)
		Emulating a natural feature
	Quetzalcoatl - featured serpent as architectural ornament

Maya
	Mostly in the jungle, so untouched
	Ceremonial buildings made up the center of Tikal
	Residential housing was mostly wood and thatch so it hasn't survived
	Tikal pyramids are very steep
		Made up of smaller, earlier pyramids inside
		During rituals priests would move from the level of the earth to the level of the sky (top of the pyramid)
	Stone causeways linking Mayan cities still exist
	Tikal has pretty steep topography overall
	Tikal had advanced water infrastructure such as reservoirs
	Filtered water that was collected from paved surfaces
	Chichen Itza (550-800 CE)
		Later city and large and ceremonial center
		Cenote: sacrificial well
		Rather than rivers, there are sinkholes that acted as wells
		Chichen Itza had two cenotes, one for ceremony and one for drinking
		Most prominent monument is the "Temple of Kukulcan" (or El Castillo) built around 1000 CE
			Four stairways
			Stepped pyramid
			Total steps add up to 365, days in a year
			18 steps with 18 months in the Mayan calendar
			Built over and encapsulating an earlier pyramid
		Temple of the Warriors is another monument
			Stepped pyramid with columns and courtyard
			Many reliefs inside the temple
		Ball courts
			Huge court for playing a major game in the Mayan culture
			High stakes - sacrifice of the losers by the winners
