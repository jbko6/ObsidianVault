### Early Medieval Christian Architecture: Charlemagne, Monasticism, Pilgrimage, Normans

What is Romanesque architecture?

In the former Roman empire in the 6th century, France was controlled by the Frankish kingdoms
In the 7th and 8th centuries, the Byzantine empire had spread to France

Charlemagne (Charles the Great)
	First Holy Roman Empire
	Ruled 768-814 = Carolingian Period
	Frankish Kingdom was expanded under him to include Rome
	Previously the King of the Frankish Kingdom
	Christian and was dubbed Holy Roman Emperor by the Pope

Early Medieval period is dubbed the dark ages
	Due to the dissolution of centralized power and infrastructure
	Very little new construction

Now with Charlemagne, construction resumes with a lot of building
	New construction heavily mimics Roman forms
