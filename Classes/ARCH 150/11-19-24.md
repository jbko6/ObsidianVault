Central entrance aligned with the Mihrab (niche that marks the direction facing Mecca)
Massive mosaic ornamentation depicting areas conquered by Islam
Minbar (pulpit) allows for someone to speak from an elevated position
Walled enclosures are not new in temples
	Seen before in the Forum of Augustus in Rome and in the Church of St. John

#### Baghdad

Prayer hall of this Mosque is roofed
Entrance has a horseshoe arch, intersecting arches
Multicolored stone work

**Romanesque achievements: Palatine Chapel**
Romanesque architecture is very much wall-based

### Gothic Architecture
Invented in the middle of France, north of Paris, at the **Abbey of St. Denis**
	Abbot Suger rebuilt the small Romanesque church in a new "pointed style"
	New chevet features pointed arches and ribbed groin vaults / rib vaults
	New large windows have stained glass
		Larger windows let more light in
		Present narrative scenes
The church at Chartres was completely renovated in the Gothic style
This is the **Cathedral of Notre Dame**
	Tall arcade
	Short gallery
	Tall clerestory
	Tons of stained glass
	Colonnettes
	Continuity - distinctive of French gothic
	Gothic church section:
		Reduced mass of nave wall
		Exterior structure of flying buttresses provides support
	Most of the structure is shifted outside so you're not really aware of it inside
	Buttress is a generic term for something that holds the wall up, but flying buttresses are unique is that they support flyers out to the nave wall
