Strategy building game where you act as architect and foremost designer for a nonprofit real estate firm that buys old 20th century properties and redevelops them to reflect new environmental and health priorities of the 21st century.

Gameplay begins with the purchase of a defunct property. Then, the player can demolish parts of the structure and rebuild it into a new, healthy property. Due to financial constraints, as well as ecological interests, it is best for the player to preserve as much of the old property as possible. Once the player has redeveloped the property, they open it up for business!
